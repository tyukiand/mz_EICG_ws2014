\exercise{3.1}{Polygon picking and snapping}
For the vertex-to-line snapping behavior we have to be able to project points 
to line segments.

Let $a, b, x\in \Real^2$ be three points, let $[a, b]$ denote the line segment
from $a$ to $b$. We want to find a point $p\in[a,b]$ such that
\[
  p = \argmin_{p^\prime \in [a, b]}\dist\rPar{p^\prime, x}.
\]
For this, we first move our coordinate system to $a$:
\begin{align*}
  d := b - a \\
  r := x - a
\end{align*}
Now the the value $\xi := \scalar{\frac{d}{\norm{d}}}{r}$ is the signed 
distance along $d$ from $a$ to the projection of $x$ to the infinite line
through $a$ and $b$. 
If $\xi$ is negative, then $p = a$ is the point closest to $x$.
If $\xi$ is greater than $\norm{d}$, then $p = b$ is the point closest to $x$.
Otherwise $p$ lies between $a$ and $b$:
\[
  p = a + \scalar{\frac{d}{\norm{d}}}{r}\frac{d}{\norm{d}} 
    = a + \frac{\scalar{r}{d}}{\norm{d}^2}d
\]
Notice that no expensive square-root operations are required so far. 
If we now wanted to compute distance from $x$ to $[a, b]$, we would just have
to compute $\norm{x - p}$, 
this can be done numerically stable with the \verb|hypot| function.

In the code, this looks as follows:
\begin{lstlisting}
/**
 * For a point `(x, y)` and a line segment `a` to `b`, computes a
 * point `p` on the line-segment `[a, b]` that is closest to `(x, y)`.
 */
void projectToLineSegment(
    double ax, double ay,
    double bx, double by,
    double x, double y,
    double &px, double &py
) {
  // `d` is the direction of the line-segment
  double dx = bx - ax;
  double dy = by - ay;

  // `r` is the position of `(x,y)` relative to `a`
  double rx = x - ax;
  double ry = y - ay;

  double rdDot = rx * dx + ry * dy;
  double dNormSq = dx * dx + dy * dy;

  // `p` is the closest point to `(x,y)` on the line segment 
  if (rdDot <= 0 || dNormSq == 0) {
    px = ax;
    py = ay;
  } else if (rdDot >= dNormSq) {
    px = bx;
    py = by;
  } else {
    double f = rdDot / dNormSq;
    px = ax + f * dx;
    py = ay + f * dy;
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}
Notice that the code handles the corner-cases where $d = 0$, which is 
important to make the code work with polygons regardless whether the first
vertex is equal to the last vertex or not.

\exercise{3.2}{Texture mapping}
The implementation of parts 3.2 (a-e) can be seen in the code, 
the main functionality is focused in the constructor of \verb|CGView|
where the texture coordinates are generated, and in \verb|CGView::paintGL|,
where the grid is rendered. Notice that we slightly modified the task:
we decided to render an almost-transparent version of the image in the 
background when the grid-mode is activated. Furthermore we avoided the
usage of deprecated \verb|GL_QUADS|, and instead achieved the same 
functionality by using simple lines and triangles.

For the part (f) we need to find a suitable diffeomorphism $\Psi_{r, \alpha}$ 
of a disk $D_r$ of the radius $r$ into itself in order to implement 
local inflation/deflation of the image. 
We decided to compose 
$\Psi_{r, \alpha}$ out of three functions. 
First, consider the following diffeomorphism between the
disk $D_r$ and the whole plane $\Real^2$ (or $\Real^n$, the dimension doesn't 
matter here):
\begin{align*}
  \phi_r: \Real^2 \to D_r       \qquad & \phi_r(x) := \frac{rx}{1 + \norm{x}} \\
  \phi_r^{-1}:  D_r \to \Real^2 \qquad & \phi_r^{-1}(x)  := \frac{x}{r - \norm{x}}.
\end{align*}
This diffeomorphism allows us to go from disk to the plane and back.
Since the plane carries a vector space structure, the \emph{scaling} operation
makes sense there. So we just go from disk to the plane, scale all points by
some fixed factor $\alpha$ and then go back to the disk:
\begin{align*}
  \Psi_{r, \alpha} & := \phi_r\circ(\alpha \cdot -) \circ \phi_r^{-1}.
\end{align*}
For the last part of the whole exercise, we will need the inverse of $\Psi_{r, \alpha}$,
this is obviously given by an analogous operation, 
but this time we scale with $\alpha^{-1}$, that is:
\begin{align*}
  \Psi_{r, \alpha}^{-1} = \Psi_{r, \alpha^{-1}}.
\end{align*}
We have included a possibility to change the brush size with ``+'' and ``-'', as
well as to reset the resulting mess with \verb|Ctrl+R|.
The inflation/deflation effect is demonstrated on the portrait of Escher.

For the deformation in (h-i), we decided to use the distance in texture coordinates,
not in world-coordinates. 
This has the effect that the whole grid behaves more like a sheet of elastic
material, and less like a lump of some very viscous sticky liquid. 
In particular, clicking in $y$ and
dragging to $x$ produces the inverse transformation of clicking in $x$ and then 
dragging to $y$. In contrast, if one uses the distance in world-coordinates, then two
points that once overlap (i.e. have the same world coordinates) can not be separated again.

The distance is computed as
\[
  r := \frac{2}{N} \sqrt{dr^2 + dc^2}  
\]
where $dr$ and $dc$ are integer \emph{index} differences of a grid vertex and the dragged vertex, 
$2$ is the width of the originally rendered rectangle, and $N$ is the number of vertex points.
Then we weight the offset of the picked point depending on the distance:
\[
  r \mapsto \exp\rPar{{-\frac{r^2}{\sigma^2}}}
\]
where we used the brush width as $\sigma$ to make the usage more or less intuitive.
Escher seems happy with this choice of the weight function:
